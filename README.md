#### Text UI Frontend

Vpxtool can act as a frontend for launching vpx files. It will index a directory of vpx files and then present a menu to
launch them.

```
> vpxtool frontend
```

## Configuration

A configuration file will be written to store among others the Visual Pinball executable location. The config file is
using the [TOML](https://toml.io) format.

When launching the frontend for the first time, it will help you to set up the required settings.

To show the current config location, use the following command

```
vpxtool config path
```

To edit the config file using your system default editor, do the following

```
vpxtool config edit
```

### Configuring vpinball paths

```yaml
vpx_executable = "/home/myuser/vpinball/VPinballX_BGFX"

  # Optional settings below, only needed if the defaults don't work
tables_folder = "/home/myuser/vpinball/tables"
vpx_config = "/home/myuser/.vpinball/VPinballX.ini"
```

Further settings will be picked up from the Visual Pinball config.

### Launch templates

Sometimes you want to use a different executables, extra arguments or environment variables. This can be done
by setting up launch templates. Each entry will show up on top of the frontend table menu.

```toml
[[launch_template]]
name = "Launch fullscreen"
executable = "/home/myuser/vpinball/VPinballX_BGFX"
args = ["-EnableTrueFullscreen"]

[[launch_template]]
name = "Launch GL"
executable = "/home/myuser/vpinball/VPinballX_GL"
[launch_template.env]
SDL_VIDEODRIVER = "X11"
```

### Configuring a custom editor

When actions are invoked that open an editor, the default editor configured for your system will be used. In case you
want to override this with a specific editor, you can add the following line to the config file:

```yaml
# use Visual Studio Code as default editor
editor = "code"
```

## Building

The project uses the default [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) build tool `cargo`. To get going read the docs on
installation and first steps at https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/

In case you are running Linux, the graphical frontend requires some extra operating system dependencies. These are
listed in the [bevy linux dependencies](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/main/docs/linux_dependencies.md)
document.

```
cargo build --release
```
