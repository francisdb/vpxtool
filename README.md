## Frontend

Vpxtool can act as a frontend for launching vpx files. It will index a directory of vpx files and then present a menu to
launch them.

## Configuration

A configuration file will be written to store the Visual Pinball executable location.

To show the current config location use the following command

```
vpxtool config show
```

### Configuring a custom editor

When actions are invoked that open an editor the default editor configured for your system will be used. In case you
want to override this with a specific editor you can add the following line to the config file:

```yaml
# use Visual Studio Code as default editor
editor = "code"
```
